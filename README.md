# 🛡️ Home Security Audit Toolkit

> **💡 Just a fun project:** This is my very first tool! It comes from a startup idea I had: imagine a "Cyber Squad" that physically visits people's homes to secure their Wi-Fi, check their devices, and install "Gold Security" packs or parental controls. The startup doesn't exist (yet!), it's just an idea, but this tool is the technical proof of concept.

## 📖 Vision & Concept
The idea was to bridge the gap between complex IT security and everyday home life. This tool is designed to show how an analyst could perform a quick on-site "Cyber Health Check-up":
* **Physical & Digital Audit:** Concrete verification of the home network and devices.
* **Security Packs:** Tiered services such as "Kids Special" or "Total Privacy."
* **Google Antigravity:** This tool was created with Google Antigravity to make the audit ultra-fast and generate a high-quality visual report for the client.

## 📊 Automated Reporting
The tool generates a **Stylized HTML Report** in seconds:

* **Security Tips:** Practical recommendations for the end user.
