# 🛡️ Home Security Audit Toolkit

> **Note :** This tool was developed to automate cybersecurity audits for residential systems. It provides a professional "Cyber Health Check" by scanning critical system settings and generating an executive report.

## 📖 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a portable solution for on-site security assessments. Instead of checking settings manually, this script runs a full audit in seconds, ensuring no vulnerability is overlooked.

## ✨ Key Security Checks
* **System Profiling:** Identification of OS, hardware, and network hostname.
* **Firewall Hardening:** Validation of active Windows Firewall profiles.
* **Antivirus Audit:** Real-time detection of active security software.
* **Account Analysis:** Identification of enabled/disabled local users to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Patch Management:** Scanning for the latest Windows security updates and pending hotfixes.
* **Network Integrity:** Analysis of IP configurations and DNS settings.

## 📊 Automated Reporting
The tool's main feature is the generation of a **Stylized HTML Report**. 
* **Executive Summary:** Pass/Fail status for critical security layers.
* **Transparency:** Detailed logs for technical review.
* **Hardening Tips:** Practical recommendations for the end-user.
